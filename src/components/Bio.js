                        <p>As a frontend developer, WordPress theme developer, and content creator, I&#8217;ve had some experience in most disciplines of digital marketing. I&#8217;ve taken websites from initial concept, through design, development, content planning and integration, launch, and post-launch support.</p>
                        <p>As a designer, I love thinking out-of-the-box and finding creative solutions to problems.</p>
                        <p>As a developer, I&#8217;m obsessive about finding the best ways to make those out-of-the-box ideas possible.</p>
                        <p>As a content creator, as long as we&#8217;re talking about written content, I&#8217;m about a versatile as they come. I&#8217;ve written everything from social media posts, to emails, blog articles, website copy, ebooks, and technical instructions.</p>
